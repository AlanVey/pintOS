            PAGE TABLE MANAGEMENT
            =====================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: (5 marks)
>> Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: (5 marks) 
>> In a few paragraphs, describe your code for locating the frame,
>> if any, that contains the data of a given page.

>> A3: (5 marks)
>> How does your code coordinate accessed and dirty bits between
>> kernel and user virtual addresses that alias a single frame, or
>> alternatively how do you avoid the issue?

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: (5 marks) 
>> When two user processes both need a new frame at the same time,
>> how are races avoided?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A5: (5 marks)
>> Why did you choose the data structure(s) that you did for
>> representing virtual-to-physical mappings?

               PAGING TO AND FROM DISK
               =======================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: (5 marks)
>> Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: (5 marks)
>> When a frame is required but none is free, some frame must be
>> evicted.  Describe your code for choosing a frame to evict.

>> B3: (5 marks)
>> When a process P obtains a frame that was previously used by a
>> process Q, how do you adjust the page table (and any other data
>> structures) to reflect the frame Q no longer has?

>> B4: (5 marks)
>> Explain your heuristic for deciding whether a page fault for an
>> invalid virtual address should cause the stack to be extended into
>> the page that faulted.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B5: (5 marks)
>> Explain the basics of your VM synchronization design.  In
>> particular, explain how it prevents deadlock.  (Refer to the
>> textbook for an explanation of the necessary conditions for
>> deadlock.)

>> B6: (5 marks)
>> A page fault in process P can cause another process Q's frame
>> to be evicted.  How do you ensure that Q cannot access or modify
>> the page during the eviction process?  How do you avoid a race
>> between P evicting Q's frame and Q faulting the page back in?

>> B7: (5 marks)
>> Suppose a page fault in process P causes a page to be read from
>> the file system or swap.  How do you ensure that a second process Q
>> cannot interfere by e.g. attempting to evict the frame while it is
>> still being read in?

>> B8: (5 marks)
>> Explain how you handle access to paged-out pages that occur
>> during system calls.  Do you use page faults to bring in pages (as
>> in user programs), or do you have a mechanism for "locking" frames
>> into physical memory, or do you use some other design?  How do you
>> gracefully handle attempted accesses to invalid virtual addresses?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: (5 marks)
>> A single lock for the whole VM system would make
>> synchronization easy, but limit parallelism.  On the other hand,
>> using many locks complicates synchronization and raises the
>> possibility for deadlock but allows for high parallelism.  Explain
>> where your design falls along this continuum and why you chose to
>> design it this way.

             MEMORY MAPPED FILES
             ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: (5 marks)
>> Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: (5 marks)
>> Describe how memory mapped files integrate into your virtual
>> memory subsystem.  Explain how the page fault and eviction
>> processes differ between swap pages and other pages.

>> C3: (5 marks)
>> Explain how you determine whether a new file mapping overlaps
>> any existing segment.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C4: (5 marks)
>> Mappings created with "mmap" have similar semantics to those of
>> data demand-paged from executables, except that "mmap" mappings are
>> written back to their original files, not to swap.  This implies
>> that much of their implementation can be shared.  Explain why your
>> implementation either does or does not share much of the code for
>> the two situations.
