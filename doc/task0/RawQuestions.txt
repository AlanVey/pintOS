1)The git command used for copying the shared repository is git-clone,
written as "git clone".

2)The function strcpy() does not specify a character limit and
therefore it does not stop until the end of the target string. In case the
destination string does not have sufficient memory allocated, the function will
write in a different region, corrupting data.
A solution to this problem is to use strlcpy, which receives a third argument,
the number of chars it has to copy. Strlcpy is similar to the more well known
function strncpy, but differs from it in the sense that it places a '\0' at the
last position if it has space(the third argument is bigger than 0).

3) Thread scheduling is done by the BSD scheduler, which handles allthe threads.
