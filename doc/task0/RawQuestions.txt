1)The git command used for copying the shared repository is git-clone,
written as "git clone".

2)The function strcpy() does not specify a character limit and
therefore it does not stop until the end of the target string. In case the
destination string does not have sufficient memory allocated, the function will
write in a different region, corrupting data.
A solution to this problem is to use strlcpy, which receives a third argument,
the number of chars it has to copy. Strlcpy is similar to the more well known
function strncpy, but differs from it in the sense that it places a '\0' at the
last position if it has space(the third argument is bigger than 0).

3) Thread scheduling is done by the BSD scheduler, which handles all the threads.

7)Every struct thread stays at the top of its meomory page, which it shares with
its stack during computation. Therefore, the struct should not be too large as
it would hinder its stack; also the stack musn't grow too large so
memory should only be managed dinamically within the thread, there should be no
allocation of static variables. The thread struct keeps a constant cal

8)After running the alarm-multiple test, in case it fails, the resulting files
can be found in:

alarm-multiple.output -> log file, records what the thread printed to stdout
alarm-multiple.result -> records result of execution
alarm-multiple.errors -> records output from stderr

4)An unsigned 64 bit integer can be printed with 'fprintf' from 'stdio.h', which
receives three argument:
a)a FILE
B)

There is no fprintf.
enum - longlong = 6
     - sizet = 8
